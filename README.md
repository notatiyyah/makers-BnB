# Makers BnB

This is a web application based on ruby and sinatra, using a psql database, with capybara for testing.
This app allows users to list spaces available to hire for the night, and allows other users to hire them.

Users will be able to log in using:
* Email
* Phone Number

Each space will be able to be personalised with info such as:
* Name
* Description
* Price
* Availability
  * Booking a space will make it unavailable

Users can request to hire, which the owner can accept or deny.
Once bookings have been confirmed, users will receive text notifications.
